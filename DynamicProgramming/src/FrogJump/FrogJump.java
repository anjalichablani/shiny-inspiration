/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/ A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each
 * unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
 * 
 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the
 * river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1
 * unit.
 * 
 * If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog
 * can only jump in the forward direction.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100. Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 2^31. The first
 * stone's position is always 0. Example 1:
 * 
 * [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
 * 
 * There are a total of 8 stones. The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit, third stone at the 3rd
 * unit, and so on... The last stone at the 17th unit.
 * 
 * Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone,
 * then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
 * 
 * Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
